## User Story
As a User
I want to be able to create an account to store my shopping list so that only I can see my shopping List.
As a user, i want to be able to add or remove my shopping list items so that I can edit them on the go
As a user, I want to be able to view my shopping list items for a set amount of time until my session expires so that my information is secure.

## Acceptance Criteria
Given a shopping list application
when a user enters their account information requirements, then the user has created a unique login.
When a user enters an item into the text form then the item appears in the need list.
When a user is inactive then the session times out.
